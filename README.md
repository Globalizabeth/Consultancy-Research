International expansion is a growth strategy that bears so much success weight if implemented properly. The way I see it, the world is going more virtual everyday. While the place of the local market cannot be displaced, digitalisation will definitely enhance its existence and this goes further to enabling a growth burst to accommodate users/customers/clients beyond that geographical area 🌍

However, it is key to note that not every business should or needs to expand globally. Remember the ‘niche’ factor? Identify what that is for your business and customers and scale-up on that 📈
